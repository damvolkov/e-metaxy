# e-organon

Generic **e-stack** API service template: **uv · ruff · ty · tach · prek · pytest · zensical · docker**.
Litestar + Granian + msgspec end to end, Rust-backed tooling.

## Quickstart

```bash
make install    # materialize the common sections + shared files, uv sync, git hooks
make check      # lint + types + architecture + drift + tests
make run        # python -m e_organon
make docs       # serve this site at http://localhost:8000
make up         # docker compose up
```

## Layout

The service lives in `src/e_organon/`, layered by [tach](https://tach.dev). `src/infra/`, `src/ops/`, `src/ports/`,
`src/providers/`, `src/engines/` and `src/processors/` are **materialized** from the infra blueprint by `make common` —
edit them there, never here:

| Module | Layer | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`e_organon.main`](reference/e_organon/main.md) | api | Composition root: explicit registration only, `create_app` for granian |
| [`e_organon.api.router.user`](reference/e_organon/api/router/user.md) | api | The user records: read by an account's key, written by the admin's, DTO families out |
| [`e_organon.api.security`](reference/e_organon/api/security.md) | api | The OpenAPI contract of the key — who may call is `infra.auth`'s, one system for both doors |
| [`e_organon.api.router.auth`](reference/e_organon/api/router/auth.md) | api | Who the key names, and the admin's accounts and keys |
| [`e_organon.api.admin`](reference/e_organon/api/admin.md) | api | A fresh admin key minted on the service's database — `python -m e_organon admin` |
| [`e_organon.api.lifespan.mcp`](reference/e_organon/api/lifespan/mcp.md) | api | The MCP server built over the door's tools and run for the app's life, mounted under `system.mcp` |
| [`e_organon.mcp.registry`](reference/e_organon/mcp/registry.md) | mcp | The door's whole surface: every tool route, resource by resource |
| [`e_organon.mcp.tools.user`](reference/e_organon/mcp/tools/user.md) | mcp | The user records as tools — the twin of `api.router.user` |
| [`e_organon.mcp.state`](reference/e_organon/mcp/state.md) | mcp | The typed branch `system.mcp` — the engine's server over the door's tools |
| [`e_organon.api.middlewares`](reference/e_organon/api/middlewares.md) | api | Correlation id, CORS and the middleware chain |
| [`e_organon.api.deps`](reference/e_organon/api/deps.md) | api | Dependency chains: store access, the auth engine, the caller, graph |
| [`e_organon.api.lifespan.infra`](reference/e_organon/api/lifespan/infra.md) | api | One-time load of the infra singletons, mirrored into `state.shared` |
| [`e_organon.api.lifespan.providers`](reference/e_organon/api/lifespan/providers.md) | api | The composition root's providers — sqlite, redis, wreq, psqlpy and the auth driver opened on one exit stack, typed by port |
| [`e_organon.api.lifespan.engines`](reference/e_organon/api/lifespan/engines.md) | api | The engines over the providers' ports — `AuthEngine` for who is asking, `HealthEngine` for the startup survey and `GET /ready` |
| [`ports.store`](reference/ports/store.md) | ports | Contracts — StorePort, HTTPPort, one per capability; the sqlite, redis and wreq drivers fill them (materialized) |
| [`providers.drivers.store.sqlite`](reference/providers/drivers/store/sqlite.md) | execution | Drivers by capability, `providers/drivers/<capability>/<name>.py` — sqlite and redis (store), wreq (http), psqlpy (database); every one logs (materialized) |
| [`engines.health`](reference/engines/health.md) | execution | Every provider surveyed at once — the startup log and the readiness verdicts (materialized) |
| [`e_organon.models.user`](reference/e_organon/models/user.md) | models | msgspec DTO families — the only place data crosses trust boundaries |
| [`e_organon.websockets.telemetry`](reference/e_organon/websockets/telemetry.md) | api | Typed websocket listeners — structured frames in and out |
| [`infra.settings`](reference/infra/settings.md) | infra | Composed settings: the `infra.config` tree mirrors the module tree, so `st.providers.drivers.store.redis.url` is the redis driver's scope (materialized) |
| [`infra.logger`](reference/infra/logger.md) | infra | Structured logging: JSON in prod, ordered plain text in dev (materialized) |
| [`infra.errors`](reference/infra/errors.md) | infra | The one root of every exception — `CoreError`, its provider, engine, processor and ops branches (materialized) |
| [`ops.crypto`](reference/ops/crypto.md) | ops | Everything that needs a key or entropy: keyed ids, bearer tokens, password hashing, JWS/JWE, AEAD (materialized) |
| [`ops.file`](reference/ops/file.md) | ops | Package discovery — the settings composer's engine (materialized) |

Reference pages are generated automatically from the sources: drop a new module under `src/` and it
appears here on the next build.
