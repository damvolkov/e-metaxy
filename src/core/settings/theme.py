"""core/settings/theme: the house theme — background, corporate hue and ink.

Three colors, no more: the background the frames sit on, the corporate hue (frames, mastheads,
rules, emphasis — the same #0277bd `ops.tui.HeaderTui` paints with) and the ink for content text.
Any surface that wants color reads it from here; a literal hex outside this file is a drift bug."""
