"""core/settings: the dynamic composer — every ``*Settings`` in this package, merged into one ``Settings``.

Each subsystem keeps its own sources (``env_prefix``, ``env_file``, ``toml_file``, ``secrets_dir``), so
adding a scope is just dropping a file here — ``__init__`` and ``base`` are the only things skipped.
Consumers import the lazy singleton: ``from e_core.core.settings import settings as st`` → ``st.crypto.alg``
(env, secrets and config files are read on that first access, never at import)."""
