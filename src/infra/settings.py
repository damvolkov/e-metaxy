"""infra/settings: the dynamic composer — every ``*Settings`` of ``infra/config``, merged into one nested ``Settings``.

The config tree mirrors the module tree: ``infra/config/providers/drivers/database/psqlpy.py`` configures
``providers/drivers/database/psqlpy.py``, and its settings are read at ``st.providers.drivers.database.psqlpy`` — the
module path, the attribute chain and the module configured are one hierarchy. Scopes that serve no provider, engine or
processor sit at the top (``st.app.env``). Each scope keeps its own sources (``env_prefix``, ``env_file``,
``toml_file``, ``secrets_dir``), so adding a scope is just dropping a file in ``infra/config`` — ``base`` is the only
thing skipped.

A project's own scopes — its services', never in the spine's config — live in ``<package>/settings/`` of any package
under ``src``, the spine's own package included when the spine lives inside it, and hang at ``st.<package>``:
``e_api/settings/orders.py`` is ``st.e_api.orders``. They are found on first use, never at import: a project's scope module may import this one, and a discovery at import would meet it
half-built. Consumers import the lazy singleton: ``from infra.settings import settings as st`` →
``st.crypto.alg`` (env, secrets and config files are read on that first access, never at import)."""
