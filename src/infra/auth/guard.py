"""infra/auth/guard: the one check between a request and its route, at both doors — the API's routes and the MCP's tools.

Who is asking is the token middleware's (`infra/auth/middleware`): a bad key never gets this far. Each entry declares
its access in its options (`opt=OPT[Access.USER]`), and `guard` — set on every router of both doors — admits the user
at it or raises the refusal it earns (401 for nobody, 403 for an account short of it), the same message whichever door.
A public entry is kept out of the middleware too: nothing is resolved for it. Litestar's own OPTIONS answer declares no
access and says only which methods a path takes: anyone's. Any other entry without an access fails loud, never open."""
