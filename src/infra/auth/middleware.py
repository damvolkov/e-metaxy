"""infra/auth/middleware: who is asking, resolved once per request before any route runs — the auth package's only door.

`TokenMiddleware` is Litestar's authentication middleware over a `CallerResolver`: the request's `Authorization` header
becomes its user (`scope["user"]`, a `Caller`), read by every guard and by the MCP door through the same scope. The
resolver is built by a lifespan after the middleware stack exists, so the composition root hands in `locate`, how to
find it on the running app — read on each request, never held. No bearer is nobody, read without a lookup; a key
nobody holds, revoked or expired is a 401 before any route, at both doors. A route that opts out (`EXCLUDED`) is
never resolved. The token never sits in the scope: `auth` stays empty. `REFUSALS` is every auth error as its HTTP
answer, the one table the doors raise from — a missing or bad key challenged as RFC 6750 asks."""
