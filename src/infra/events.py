"""infra/events: events delivered in this process — subscribers by event type, none known to the publisher.

`subscribe(kind, handler)` binds a handler to an event type; `publish(event)` hands the event to a bounded stream and
returns: a slow listener delays the next delivery, never the publisher — until CAPACITY events wait, then publishing
waits too (backpressure, never an unbounded queue). One task delivers, in order, each event to every handler of its
type in subscription order; a handler that raises is logged and skipped, the others and the next events still go.

A producer depends on `EventsPort` alone — `MemoryEvents` is its in-process engine, a queue-backed one is another
adapter of the same port. The engine is entered by its lifespan: entering starts the delivery, leaving delivers what
is still waiting and stops."""
