"""infra/mcp/bridge: a tool call as one request to the app itself — in process, through its middleware and guards.

The call passes its dependencies, its validation and its exception handlers, exactly as any route is served.

The request is born from the MCP endpoint's own: its `user` (the token middleware resolved it there, once), its server
and client, its correlation id; the arguments its JSON body; the guard's mark in its scope, which no client can send.
A 2xx answer is the tool's text and, when an object, its value — a list is wrapped as `result`, as the protocol wants
an object; a refusal is the route's own `detail`, or the arguments its validation named."""
