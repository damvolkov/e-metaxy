"""infra/background: the in-process task supervisor — jobs as tasks of one task group, retries, progress, cancel, clocks.

A job is a kind (registered once, with its handler) run on a queue with kwargs: it is queued at once, runs when its
queue has a free slot (`slots` at once per queue), retries until its `attempts` are spent, and settles `completed`,
`failed` or `cancelled`; the last `keep` settled ones stay readable. A schedule is a cron whose clock is a task of the
same group, so nothing outlives the process — or survives it. `BackgroundReport` is the reporter a work receives: the
latest snapshot it reports becomes the job's `progress`, written at most every `throttle` seconds and always once more
when the work ends.

The values here (job, state, run, handler) are the vocabulary of every queue: `ports/queue` speaks them, and
`engines/dispatch` prefers a durable engine and falls back to this supervisor when it is absent or unreachable."""
