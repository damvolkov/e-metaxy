"""core.middlewares: the ASGI stack both doors share, declared once as data — correlation, CORS, the access log.

The REST routes and the mounted MCP app sit behind the same stack: one request id, one access line per call.
The config struct lives in `core.settings.api`; this module translates it into litestar and owns the house middleware.
