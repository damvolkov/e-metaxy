"""core.lifespan.state: Litestar's application state, typed — one entry, the system graph every lifespan fills and seals.

Litestar owns `app.state` and types it as its own `State`; replacing it with another class breaks that
contract and forces a cast at every read. Instead `AppState` *is* a Litestar `State`, handed to the
constructor, holding one typed entry: `system`, the core `State` graph (auto-vivifying while the
lifespans build it, sealed once they are done). Litestar itself builds this class wherever a
dependency annotates the reserved `state: AppState` — HTTP and websocket alike — and lifespans,
which receive the app, narrow it with `AppState.of(app)`: a runtime check, never a cast."""
