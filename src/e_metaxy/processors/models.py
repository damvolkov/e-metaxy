"""processors/models: what the processors hand out — a document read, or the Markdown a file becomes, both typed.

Interior data built by code: frozen, slotted dataclasses, never a boundary model. Whoever read a page
(liteparse or docling, see `Page.backend`), its objects look the same: every one keeps its `ref` — the
engine and its own pointer (`docling:110-119#/tables/3`, `liteparse:p44/b7`) — and the `page` it sits
on, so anything extracted from it traces back to where it was read. Labels follow docling's vocabulary
(`section_header`, `text`, `list_item`, `formula`, ...): liteparse blocks are mapped onto it."""
