"""processors/md: the MDProcessor — any file to Markdown, detected and rendered by the anytomd engine.

Detection, every format's conversion, PDF reading and image description live behind one port (`MdConvertPort`,
anatomd's binding); this processor only guards the size, unpacks a ZIP and re-enters each member in parallel,
and records an engine's failure per file so one bad member never sinks a batch. It holds no state: `convert`
is a pure function of bytes that returns a typed list of rendered files."""
