"""e-organon entrypoint: assembly by explicit registration only — importing this module does nothing.

`create_app` is the composition root and the factory granian calls per worker. One Litestar app serves both doors:
the REST routes, and the MCP endpoint whose tools are routes too (`mcp/registry`), each reached in process by the MCP
engine (`infra/mcp`) and answering it alone. Both sit behind the same middleware stack — the caller resolved once, from
the key — and the same guard, at the access each route and tool declares. Routers and websockets enter through
`register` calls — the include_router shape; middleware, the lifespan chain and CORS enter through the constructor, and
the order of `lifespan=[...]` is the startup order: infra first (every later concern may depend on the loaded
singletons), then the providers, the engines over their ports and the services, the MCP server, sealed last. Dependency
chains are wired by each endpoint, never here. Nothing loads at import; the infra singletons load on the first touch,
which the infra lifespan makes.
