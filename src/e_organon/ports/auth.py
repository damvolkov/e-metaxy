"""ports/auth: where accounts and grants are kept — the one contract an auth engine needs of a store.

Any store meets it by shape (Postgres today: `providers/drivers/auth/postgres`). Grants are kept by digest only; whether
a grant still holds (revoked, expired) is the engine's judgement, never the store's. The value types — accounts and
grants — are `infra/auth/models`."""
