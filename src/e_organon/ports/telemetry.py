"""ports/telemetry: tracing — a span opened around a block, written until it ends, settled by how the block left.

The vocabulary is the service's, never a vendor's: a span may carry a `SpanRole` (what kind of work it times) and
attributes keyed by `SpanKey` (a meaning) or a free dotted name; the provider translates role and keys into its own
conventions. `carrier` and `resume` move a trace across a queue or a process as an opaque mapping."""
