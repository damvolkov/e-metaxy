`POST /auth/accounts/{name}/token` needs the admin's key to hand out keys; the first one comes from here, on the service's
own host (`python -m e_organon admin`): the database provisioned, the auth tables made, the admin's account rotated through
the same engine and driver the service runs — every earlier admin key revoked, the new one shown this once."""
