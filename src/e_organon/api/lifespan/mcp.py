"""api.lifespan.mcp: the MCP engine built over the door's tools, its session manager run for the app's life.

The tools are the door's routes (`mcp/registry`), read into the engine's registry (`infra/mcp`): what a client lists,
what the bridge calls. The server is built here, after the engines the tools reach exist, and lands under `system.mcp`
(`mcp/state`), where the endpoint's mount forwards to it. Who is asking is the token middleware's, before the server sees
the request; each tool admits the caller at its own access. The transport refuses any Host or Origin that is not this
service's: MCP_HOSTS and MCP_ORIGINS say which, and empty they are this port on `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`.
