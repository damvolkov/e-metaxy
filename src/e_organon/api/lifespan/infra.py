"""api.lifespan.infra: the first touch of the shared logger, mirrored as a typed graph section.

`settings` was read at import (`Settings()`, once); `logger` is a `LazyProxy`: its first attribute access configures
structlog. This lifespan *is* that first access, and it deposits the logger under `system.shared` for consumers that
prefer the graph. Settings never travel on the graph: the composition root reads `st` and hands values down."""
