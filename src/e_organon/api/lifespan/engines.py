"""api.lifespan.engines: build the engines over the providers' ports, then survey every provider once.

The concern owns its subtree as a typed section: `EnginesState` holds each engine by its role. The engines keep
references and configuration only, so this concern owns no resource to close. `auth` is the engine every door asks who
is calling (the token middleware reads it off the sealed graph); with a secret set its admin account is made here, no
key issued. `health` surveys every provider at once (each under PING_TIMEOUT, so the whole takes the slowest): right
after they open — one log event each, never a failed start — and on every `GET /ready`. Required are `store`, the
provider the app's records live on, and `auth`, without which no key resolves; every other provider is reported, never
blocking."""
