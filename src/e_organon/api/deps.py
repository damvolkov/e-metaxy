"""api.deps: chained dependency providers — litestar resolves the graph recursively per request.

No FastAPI `Depends()` sugar: binding is by *name*. Each link declares what it consumes in its own
signature (`store` takes `graph`), every route wires the chains it uses in a local `dependencies` mapping, and the app
itself registers nothing. Links run once per request, in resolved order; independent links run concurrently.

Who may reach a route is `infra/auth/guard`'s, the same check the MCP door's tools pass; `caller` hands the user the
token middleware resolved to the handlers that take it.
