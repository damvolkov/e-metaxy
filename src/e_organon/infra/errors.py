"""infra/errors: the one root of every error — each layer imports its exceptions from here, none defines its own.

`CoreError` is the root. Five branches hang from it, one per kind of module: `ProviderError` (a provider failed at its
border), `EngineError`, `ProcessorError`, `OpsError` and `ServiceError` — the slot of a project's own business, the
one layer that never travels, so the tree names the branch and the project fills it. Providers translate the exceptions of their library into the
provider branch; no upper layer imports a library's own.

A provider fails as a **driver** (`DriverError`: a system outside the process) or as an **adapter** (`AdapterError`: a
library inside it). A capability met on both natures raises an error that is honestly both: `CacheError` (theine in
memory, Postgres over the wire) and `DocumentError` (docling-serve over HTTP, docling in process) inherit
`DriverError` and `AdapterError` at once, so `except DriverError` and `except AdapterError` each catch the failure of
the nature they guard."""
