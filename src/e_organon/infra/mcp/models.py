"""infra/mcp/models: the vocabulary of the MCP engine — a tool as a route declares it, and a call's answer.

A tool as the registry reads it, a call's answer as the bridge brings it back. No SDK type here: `server` alone speaks
the protocol.

A tool is a Litestar route whose options carry its `MCPTool` under `TOOL`, at its access; `MCPTool.route` is that route,
on `PATH/<name>`: POST, out of the OpenAPI spec, its options the access, the tool, and authentication left out — the
caller rides in from the MCP endpoint's own request, resolved there once."""
