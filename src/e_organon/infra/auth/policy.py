"""infra/auth/policy: what a caller may do — pure rules, no store, no door.

`allow` ranks a caller's role against an entry's access: the admin passes everything, an account everything short of
the admin's, nobody only what any caller may. `admit` is the same rule as a verdict: the caller let through, or the
refusal it earns — nobody short of an entry is asked for a key, an account short of it is forbidden —, one typed error
and one message, whichever door maps it. `owns` says whether a caller may act on what someone holds: the admin on
anything, an account on its own, nobody on nothing."""
