"""engines/dispatch: background work by kind — on the durable queue when it answers, in memory when it does not.

A work is registered once by kind, on a queue, and submitted by kwargs: `await dispatch.submit("annotate",
documents=(...), force=True)` answers at once with the job, queued. The work receives those kwargs and a reporter: each
snapshot it reports (plain builtins) becomes the job's `progress`, written at most every `throttle` seconds and always
once more when the work ends. A work that returns completes its job; one that raises is retried until its `attempts`
are spent; a cancel interrupts it where it awaits.

The engine holds the in-process supervisor (`infra/background`) and prefers the durable `QueuePort`: a queue absent,
unreachable on entry, or failing one enqueue sends the work to memory with a warning, never a crash. A durable queue
reports an outage as `QueueError`; any other error is the caller's and propagates. Ids are strings, a queue's own, so a
lookup asks memory first, then the durable.

Registration — `queue`, `register`, `schedule` — is open until the engine is entered: every client declares its own
queues, kinds and schedules first, and once it starts the registry is sealed (a late one is a `DispatchError`, never a
work that silently never runs). `kinds` and `schedules` read what was declared, whichever client declared it.

A job is traced when a tracer is handed (the composition root's `TelemetryEngine`, met by shape): `submit` sends the
current trace along in the job's arguments (`_trace`, an opaque carrier — never handed to the work, never compared when
coalescing), and the run is a `job.<kind>` span, the child of that trace across the queue, each snapshot an event on it
and the last one written on the span itself.

A schedule puts a registered kind on a cron: on each tick the engine submits it, coalesced, so a run that has not
started yet absorbs the next tick; the work itself always runs as a job, with its retries, progress and record. The
clock belongs to the durable queue when it keeps one (`SchedulePort`: one fire per tick across every process),
else to the supervisor. Which concrete queue is the durable one is the composition root's decision, never this module's."""
