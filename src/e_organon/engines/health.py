"""engines/health: every provider asked how it is, at once — the startup survey and the readiness route's verdicts.

`survey` calls `health` on many providers together (`asyncio.gather`, each under the same limit, so the whole takes the
slowest one and one that hangs holds none of the rest) and answers one `ProviderHealth` per provider, never a raise: the
lifespan logs it at startup, `GET /ready` serves it. A provider that is down raises its own error, and the error is the
verdict's reason (`DatabaseError: connection refused`) — what the readiness route shows; one that outlasts the limit is
down and says so; one that answers False (a provider of no one's) is down, its reason only `unhealthy`."""
