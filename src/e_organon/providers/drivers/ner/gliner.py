"""providers/drivers/ner/gliner: zero-shot entities from a gliner service — `POST /ner/batch`, NDJSON streamed both ways.

A request is one header line (the labels and the threshold for every item) and one line per text, its id its index;
the body is a generator, so the service reads it as it is produced. The answer is one line per text as each completes,
out of order, matched back by id; a line the service refused (`{"id"|"line", "error"}`) or a text left unanswered fails
the call with a `ModelError` — never "found nothing". The service bounds its own predictions; `timeout` bounds the
wait for each next line, not the whole stream. Opening calls nothing: a process may start with the service down.
`refresh` reads the served model card (`GET /models`) — `gliner:<model>@<version>`, the version a digest of the model's
files — so a promotion there is another annotator here from the next read on.

It keeps a wreq client of its own, not an `HTTPPort`: the port speaks JSON bodies, and this exchange streams a request
body and reads the answer frame by frame."""
