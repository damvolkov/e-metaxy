"""providers/drivers/queue/pgqueuer: the default durable queue, PgQueuer behind `QueuePort` and `SchedulePort`.

It rides the database it is handed — a `DatabasePort` and a `ListenPort`, met by either Postgres driver, the lifespan
opening it first and closing it last — and opens no pool of its own. PgQueuer reaches the database through its own
`Driver` port, met here by `PgqueuerBridge` over ours: statements on a scope of the database — the pool, one transaction
(an enqueue and its record), one connection (the schema's session lock) —, LISTEN on the database's `ListenPort`, one
connection the database driver holds for every channel. The database's pool serves every manager at once: at least six
connections (fewer stalls a manager under load, measured on e-gnosis). A database that fails under it is a `QueueError`.

PgQueuer has no queues, only entrypoints: each port queue is one entrypoint, the kind travels in the payload and picks
the handler. A queue's `slots` is the entrypoint's `concurrency_limit`, counted in SQL over every worker of the
database (fleet-wide, not per process): PgQueuer refuses a per-worker cap below twice its batch, so a
slot of one is only expressible this way. A settled job leaves PgQueuer's queue table (its log keeps status, picks and
tracebacks, never the payload), so this driver keeps each job's kind, queue, args, attempts and latest snapshot in
`background.job`, written in the enqueue's own transaction. Retries are the driver's: a failed attempt with attempts
left raises `RetryRequested`. Each queue runs one `QueueManager`; a manager that dies is restarted by a supervisor after
QUEUE_RESTART — PgQueuer does not restart by itself.

Schedules are PgQueuer's own: one `SchedulerManager`, supervised like the managers, keeps every schedule in PgQueuer's
schedules table and claims each due tick in the database, so a tick fires once across every process holding the
schedule; the fire runs in this process."""
