"""e_organon.mcp.refusals: a domain error as the tool's refusal — the API's own exceptions answer as they do, a tool adds none.

A refusal is the route's `detail`, which the MCP engine hands back as the tool's error text. The user records raise
Litestar's own `NotFoundException`; a domain error of a service becomes a row here, mapped to the status it earns."""
