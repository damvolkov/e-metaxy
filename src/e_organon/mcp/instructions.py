    "and which of its providers answer — any caller may ask. api_user_list and api_user_read read the user records "
    "and need an account's key; api_user_create, api_user_update and api_user_delete write them and need the "

    "in the loop. A refusal is the API's own words: no key, or a key short of the tool's access."
