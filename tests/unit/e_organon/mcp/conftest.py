"""tests/unit/e_organon/mcp: the MCP door as a client meets it — the real app over the fake accounts and the in-memory store, its
endpoint reached by the SDK's own client (`support/mcp`): none is nobody, `ana_key` and `root_key` carry the keys of an
account and the admin.

`client` here is the async one the SDK client needs (the lifespans run for the test's length), its user records wiped;
`connect` opens the SDK client on `/mcp`."""
