"""tests/unit/e_organon/api/state: Litestar's own state class, typed, installed by the composition root — and law 22, checked:
the attribute chain of the sealed system is the module path.

The real lifespan chain fills and seals the system; the whole tree is walked. Every node whose class is a stratum's
lives in the package its chain names: a `system.logic.store` in `e_organon.logic.store`. Tools (ops, providers, engines,
processors, infra's wrappers, builtins, mappings, third parties) are no node of a stratum; the infrastructure sections
(`shared`, `providers`, `engines`) are walked, their own classes never placed. The blueprint mounts no stratum yet: the
gate holds for the first one a project adds. And one object, one path: nothing the system holds lives at two."""
